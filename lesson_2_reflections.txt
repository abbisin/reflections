What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

to create a set of mini data for a specific location. Since then, files in that location or directory will be traced. audit trail of these files will be marked. a version control function is being setup for that specific directory. 
all git version control function can then be implemented and used

================================

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

an intermediate space between working directory and repository. helps u to define what files to trace by commit. 
it gives u flexibility that you can only put a subset of files under tracking, to keep the git log tidy and clear and focus on the area u want to trace.
It also tells u the unstaging files, so u can always know what are not traced, and add them to staging area whenever needed.

=====================

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

by comparing the staging area and the previuos commit (using git diff --staged) we can review what has been changed so far. Then we can consider whether the accumulated changes are sufficient for a logical commit version

=====================

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

to create another "workable version" of the product. say with some new features, in another language, usually targetting another group of audience.

it gives layer or structure to the commit repository. like managing the commit by different labels or foloders.

===================

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

to merge the changes made in branch to the master, creaste new master to inherited the features from the branch

all commits in the branch will be merged to the new master

===================

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

pros: save time, less manual error, higher accuracy to detect conflict area
cons: need to resolve only the conflict, maybe less aware what features are invovled ?
