What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

to create a set of mini data for a specific location. Since then, files in that location or directory will be traced. audit trail of these files will be marked. a version control function is being setup for that specific directory. 
all git version control function can then be implemented and used

================================

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

an intermediate space between working directory and repository. helps u to define what files to trace by commit. 
it gives u flexibility that you can only put a subset of files under tracking, to keep the git log tidy and clear and focus on the area u want to trace.
It also tells u the unstaging files, so u can always know what are not traced, and add them to staging area whenever needed.
